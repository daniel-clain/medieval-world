* not classes for primary modules
  - why?, a creater function that returns a type has its separation split in 2 places and a lot is duplicated
    - eg you make the type and declare what it takes and what it returns, and then in the creator function you do the same again

* creater functions instead
  - why?, you can spread other composable parts into the object
