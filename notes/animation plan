* to make the animations look good
  - the appropriate time should be given to each frame
    ~ some should be short to give a quick motion feel
  - each new image should keep the character in a relative spot, it should not jump around

* the sprite sheen has 8 facing directions
  - n, ne, e, se, s, sw, w, nw
  - as the characters direction changes, the sprite image should change to the same frame of a different facing angle
    ~ eg if a walk animation has 5 stages, and the unit changes direction on the 3rd stage, then it should be the 3rd stage in the changed direction
